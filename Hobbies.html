            <dt class="underline_dt">Flight Simulators</dt>
            <dd>I like to fly in Flight Simulators. The most simulator I used for virtual flight is Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. My favorite airplane is Boeing 777-300ER, the largest airplane with 2 engines in the world. Boeing 777-300ER represented the development of modern science and technology industry with the second powerful engine GE90. I enjoy when I fly into cloud and crossing dusk line. Humans cannot fly, but they are the fastest birds on earthã€‚</dd>

            <dt class="underline_dt">Programming</dt>
            <dd>I love programming because it offers the freedom to create and solve problems in innovative ways. It's always my fault if I did something error, computer follows my command, I have no one can blame. It gives me a sense of accomplishment when I turn ideas into functional solutions or products. Programming also allows me to continuously learn, as technologies evolve and new challenges arise. It was similar to build legos, every step with attention.</dd>
